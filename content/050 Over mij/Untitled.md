> [!bible]+ [Genesis 2:18-25 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/2/)
> 18. The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.”
> 19. Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
> 20. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field.<br/>But for Adam no suitable helper was found.
> 21. So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs and closed up the place with flesh.
> 22. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.
> 23. The man said,<br/>“This is now bone of my bones<br/>and flesh of my flesh;<br/>she shall be called ‘woman,’<br/>for she was taken out of man.”
> 24. For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.
> 25. The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.
